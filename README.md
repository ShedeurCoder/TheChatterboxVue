# About The Chatterbox

The Chatterbox is a social platform where you can talk and connect with other users.

The Chatterbox is a great way to connect with people. You can say about anything, and you can meet about anyone! In The Chatterbox, we aim to connect us humans, because as technology progresses, so does alone time. We make it easy here at The Chatterbox for everyone to talk! 

We started when Shedeur B, our founder, just learned how to do back-end code. He didn't know what to make, so he just made a Twitter lite. A bit over a year later, after Shedeur learned Vue, he created The Chatterbox Vue to practice his Vue skills.

The Chatterbox Social Media was founded June 13, 2022. The first release was on July 4, 2022. The Chatterbox is owned and managed by Chibs Incorporated with Shedeur Bhatkal as the CEO of The Chatterbox.

The Chatterbox started development of a new version based on Vue on July 23, 2023, and was first released on July 29, 2023. Just like the original The Chatterbox, it is owned and managed by Chibs Incorporated with Shedeur Bhatkal as CEO. It also has only 1 developer.

After May 31, 2024, this version of The Chatterbox is the only version being actively worked on and online. To view the source code of our old version made with Express.js, visit https://github.com/ShedeurCoder/thechatterbox
